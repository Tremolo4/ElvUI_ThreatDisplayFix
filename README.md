Download latest version from [releases tab](https://github.com/Tremolo4/ElvUI_ThreatDisplayFix/releases).

To support colors similar to WotLK (orange/yellow), you need ThreatLib-2.0, which is included in e.g. [Omen](https://www.wowace.com/projects/omen-threat-meter/files/191727).  
There are no additional settings.  
You can configure how the aggro indicator should be displayed in each ElvUI unit frame settings ("Threat Display Mode").

Known issues:
- Icons don't work
- Indicator color (red/orange/yellow) doesn't always work as expected
